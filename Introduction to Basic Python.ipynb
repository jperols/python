    "A variable consists of a variable name (identifier) and a storage location that can store a value that can be referenced using the variable name.  When using variables in Python:\n",
    " - There is no need to declare the variables. Simply type:  \n",
    " variable_name = constant\n",
    " - Variable names\n",
    "    - Are case sensitive (use lower case letters and underscores to connect multiple words)\n",
    "    - Can only contain alpha-numeric characters (and underscores)\n",
    "    - Cannot start with numbers\n",
    "    - Variable names that are easy to understand.\n",
    " - Data types\n",
    "    - Variables can store integers, float, Boolean, and strings (a specific variable can change type after it has first been set)\n",
    "    - To find out the data type of the value in a variables use type(variable_name)\n",
    "    - Converting/casting data types using int(), float(), and str(), e.g., int(variable_name).  The table below provides more information about these functions. When casting, the actual data type of the variable is not changed (the casting is not done in-place, i.e., a copy is returned and the original variable is left unmodified).\n",

    "### Data Structures\n",
    "#### Overview  \n",
    "Data structures (e.g., sequences and dictionaries) store multiple values. Python has a number of data structures, including sequence data such as lists and strings, and dictionaries:\n",
    " - Sequence Data - lists and strings are both sequence data types (the order of the data matters) where the initial elements is assigned the index 0 (i.e., sequences are zero-based numbered), the second element then has index 1, and so on. Negative index is used to index starting from the last element of the sequence, e.g., -1 refers to the last index, -2 refers to the second last index, and so on (see the examples section below for a picture of this).\n",
    "   - __Strings__ store characters and are immutable (they are not designed to be extended or reduced). Each string is enclose by quotation marks, e.g.,:  \n",
    "   *company_name = 'ACME'*. \n",
    "   - __Lists__ can contain a mix of different data types and are mutable.  The elements in lists are separated by commas and the list of elements is enclosed by square brackets, e.g.,: \n",
    "   *list_name = [57.68, True, 'ACME']*.\n",
    "   - (There is also a data structure called a tuple that can contain any type of object like a list but is immutable list a string; tuple data structures are generally used for heterogeneous (different) datatypes and list for homogeneous (similar) datatypes. Since tuple are immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.  The elements in tuples are separated by commas and the tuple is enclose by parentheses, e.g., (57.68, True, 'ACME'). We focus on lists (and strings) because they use square brackets and behave similarly to numpy arrays and pandas dataframes, which is what we will be using almost exclusively later).  \n",
    "   - Lists and strings share a number of methods, including methods for extracting specific elements).  The examples below focus on lists, but the concepts also apply to strings.\n",
    " - A __dictionary__ is a sequence of items that is not sorted. Dictionaries are not sorted. Each item is a pair made of a key and a value (think attribute name and attribute value) separated by colons. Items are separated by commas and the list of items is enclosed in curly brackets, e.g.,:  \n",
    " *dictionary_name = {'Expenses': 57.68, 'Audit Opinion' : True, 'Company Name' : 'ACME']*."

When slicing, we create a new list that is the reverse of the original list.  When using reverse we reverse the list in-place (we directly modify the original list).  When using reversed we create an iterator object. We can of course create additional code that further modify the output and makes the outcomes equivalent, but the performance is generally best if the approach is selected based on the desired output. As an extra exercise try using this two alternatives to create a reversed list.  Note that you need to use list(iterator) to create a list from an iterator."

There are also two specific methods that can be used to achieve the same result: append to add a single element and extend to add multiple elements (a list) to an existing list.

    "### Control Flow  \n",
    "The statements in your code are executed in the order that they appear (from top to bottom), but control flow statements can be used to change this top to bottom execution by executing particular statements based on conditional statements and loops.  Conditional statements are implemented in Python using if, elif, else statements and loops are implemented using for loops (while loops are also supported, but they are uncommon in Python data analytics).  Generally, when using Python for data analytics tasks, it is better to avoid if, elif, else and for loops and instead perform the needed work using functions and methods provided in various libraries.  Not only does this allow us to avoid reinventing the wheel, the code provided by well established libraries also performs better in terms of execution time (this code is created in C and other lower level languages, which are faster, rather than Python and has been optimized). This is a major reason why NumPy and Pandas are so important (we will cover NumPy and Pandas in the next two tutorials). There are, however, times when there are no suitable functions in established libraries to help you and then you need to create your own code.  Further, other developers often create code that uses control flow statements and to understand their code it is important to understand these statements.   \n",

Python for loops are designed specifically iterate over some type of iterable – typically lists or strings.  For example, a for loop can be used to do something with each element in a list, i.e., we loop over each element in an existing list.  In the most basic form, the for loop will access the value of each element in a list:\n",

    "To increase code readability, aliases are typically only used when it is customary to do so, e.g., when searching for help you will notice things like NumPy being referenced as np, Pandas as pd, StatsModels as sm, etc.  These aliases are fine because of how commonly they are used, but when a specific alias is not commonly used then using the alias can make it difficult to understand the code.  Similarly, it is generally recommended that packages are imported (or packages and modules) rather than specific functions and that dot notation is subsequently used in the code to reference a specific function. If a single function is imported (and dot notation is not used in the code), it can be difficult to know which package the function belongs to (and if this is unclear then it becomes more difficult to understand the code and to search for help about the function).  However, dot notation can also get very long which can also decrease code readability and increase the time it takes to write the code and the risk for typos.  How far to go with dot notation depends on what is customary for the specific package/module/function.  When I am unsure what is customary, I generally import packages/modules so that when I call a function I show one level above the function (which typically is the package) and I only occasionally use aliases."
